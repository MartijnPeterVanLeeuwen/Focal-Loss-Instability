# Focal-Loss-Instability

This repository provides additional information regarding our paper on the stability of the Focal loss. The Focal loss is a popular loss function designed to deal with class-imbalanced datasets, and is parameterized by a focusing parameter $\gamma$ that determines the degree to which easy examples are downscaled. In our paper (link), we addressed a focal loss instability that can occur whenever this focusing parameter $\gamma$ is set to a value between 0 and 1 due to a singularity in the derivative of the Focal loss.\\\\
To prove that this instability is not only a theoretical issue, we have demonstrated that the instability can be detected in a two-binary classification and one segmentation experiment. The code for these experiments is included in this repository. In this paper, we also provide a solution to the instability by adding a smoothing constant to the modulating factor that downscales the cross-entropy loss. We have repeated the experiments with this modified version of the focal loss and have shown that no more instabilities are found. The modified version of the Focal loss can be found in this repository as well.

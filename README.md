# Focal-Loss-Instability

This Github page provides the code that highlights an instbality of the Focal loss, whenever $\gamma$ value between 0 and 1 is used. We will provide the code that we used to run our experiments, and will provide the code for the modified Focal loss, that does not suffer from this instability.
